# spotify-analytics
An ETL pipeline for collecting user streaming data from the Spotify API

Publishing code snippets as this project progresses, currently the ET part of the ETL is up :) A script that authorises and saves raw json data from the Spotify API, and a script that converts this json file into two CSV files: metadata and individual streaming data.
